    "With the NBA API it was a trial and error process to pull data. It did not seem like there was a definitive reason why data was not pulling. So we built a script that would simply run multiple passes over a unique games list and try to get a complete set of data. This proved to be successful. Even testing different sleep times proved to be unsuccessful.\n",

We needed to collect a set for the first half and the complete game this would give us a complete picture of the data so we could predict a second half point total. We also used \"boxscoresummaryv2\" to collect game times, referees, injuries, points by qtr. It would basically pull a list of 7 tables, the multiple pass code was neccesarily for this as it seemed to fail to pull more often. In addition we had to patch this API pull to code in 'GAME_ID' for a couple of the tables that did not have it present."

    "Basically as we were testing we found out that the Vegas line is actually very very good. Even without using first half data its actually better then our tuned XGBoost model. Knowing that we have the Vegas second half total we used that as a residual in another XGBoost model, which gave us some improvements over the Vegas line. Is this enough to make betting model that is profitable? We do not quite know yet. \n",

NN might not be the best choice because we do not have enough data to find even more complicated patterns. Also we took out player names to make sure the model generalizes.
