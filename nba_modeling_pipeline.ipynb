    "With the NBA API it was a trial and error process to pull data. It did not seem like there was a definitive reason why data was not pulling. So we built a script that would simply run multiple passes over a unique games list and try to get a complete set of data. This proved to be successful. Even testing different sleep times proved to be unsuccessful.\n",

We needed to collect a set for the first half and the complete game this would give us a complete picture of the data so we could predict a second half point total. We also used \"boxscoresummaryv2\" to collect game times, referees, injuries, points by qtr. It would basically pull a list of 7 tables, the multiple pass code was neccesarily for this as it seemed to fail to pull more often. In addition we had to patch this API pull to code in 'GAME_ID' for a couple of the tables that did not have it present."

    "Why not try a very complex NN MLP model to see if we can get anything. This model ended up performing better than a very WIDE model with 1024 as the first layer. We originally thought given the large feature set that it might be better but it performed worse. NN might not be the best choice because we do not have enough data to find even more complicated patterns. Also we took out player names to make sure the model generalizes. Perhaps in a future project we could try to just NN everything."
