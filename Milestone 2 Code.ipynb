    "With the NBA API it was a trial and error process to pull data. It did not seem like there was a definitive reason why data was not pulling.

Even testing different sleep times proved to be unsuccessful.\n",

We needed to collect a set for the first half and the complete game this would give us a complete picture of the data so we could predict a second half point total. We also used \"boxscoresummaryv2\" to collect game times, referees, injuries, points by qtr. It would basically pull a list of 7 tables, the multiple pass code was neccesarily for this as it seemed to fail to pull more often. In addition we had to patch this API pull to code in 'GAME_ID' for a couple of the tables that did not have it present."

Knowing that we have the Vegas second half total we used that as a residual in another XGBoost model, which gave us some improvements over the Vegas line.
